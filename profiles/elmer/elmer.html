          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            Originally born in El Salvador, I am a senior in Computer Science
            at Virginia Tech. My passion for learning drives me to constantly
            innovate and embrace change. The best way to learn, however, is by
            doing. The application of theoretical knowledge to the wonderfully
            complex and imperfect world we live in is what keeps me motivated.
            I strive to strike a balance between pragmatism, theory and
            research. Whenever possible I also try to incorporate other
            disciplines and areas of study into my work. It is by this mixture
            of different areas of expertise and working with other highly
            motivated individuals that I believe the best type of work can be
            achieved. I love working in groups, in my experience a group of
            well balanced individuals can out perform any lone range (however
            brilliant he/she might be) any day of the week. After all, we human
            beings are social creatures.

          <h3>Interests & Work</h3>
          <p>
            These are some projects I have worked on in school, during my undergraduate research and my internship.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>Web Server</dt>
            <dd>Developed a simple HTTP server that followed the HTTP/1.0 and
              1.1 standard. I implemented this in C and gained expereince in
              dealing with network connections, sockets, pipes, and thread
              pools.</dd>
            <dt>Memory Allocator</dt>
            <dd>This memory allocator supported the same functionality as
              <code>malloc</code>, <code>free</code>, and <code>realloc</code>.
              On top of having the same functionality as these functions it
              also had comparable performance (92%). This memory allocator was
              also design to work on 32 and 64-bit architectures.</dd>
            <dt>B-Tree visualization infrastructure</dt>
            <dd>While working with
              <a href="http://algoviz.org/OpenDSA/">OpenDSA</a>, I extended a
              JavaScript visualization library to support the creation of
              B-Tree. This involved the modification and adaptation of
              existing data structures to allow for the needs of a B-Tree.
              Currently, I'm in the process of implementing the B-Tree
              algorithm in JavaScript that will drive the visualization.</dd>
